# Bachelor Portal

The Bachelor Portal is a web-based application that provides students with access to Bachelor project opportunities. It streamlines the entire Bachelor project process, from preparation by lecturers, coordinators, TAs, companies, employees, and external supervisors to student registration and final grading.
